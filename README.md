Implementing joins on databases for Olin's Database class, 2019

nestedLoops.py is an implementation that purely uses nested loops in order to perform joins.

hashJoin.py is an implementation that uses hash tables to join on equality-based joins, and nested loops otherwise.

comparisons.py runs equality joins between the two, times them, and ensures that they return the same result.
